criterion is one of the most popular discriminant criteria for feature extraction. It is defined as the generalized Rayleigh quotient of the between-class scatter distance to the within-class scatter distance. Consequently, Fisher’s criterion does not take advantage of the discriminant information in the class covariance differences and hence its discriminant ability largely depends on the class mean differences. If the class mean distances are relatively large compared with the within-class scatter distance, Fisher’s criterion based discriminant analysis methods may achieve a good discriminant performance. Otherwise, it may not deliver good results. Moreover, we observe that the between-class distance of Fisher’s criterion is based on the ℓ2 norm, which would be disadvantageous to separate the classes with smaller class mean distances. To overcome the drawback of Fisher’s criterion, in this paper we firstly derive a new discriminant criterion, expressed as a mixture of absolute generalized Rayleigh quotients (MAGRQ), based on a Bayes error upper bound estimation, where mixture of Gaussians is adopted to approximate the real distribution of data samples. Then, the criterion is further modified by replacing ℓ2 norm with ℓ1 one to better describe the between-class scatter distance, such that it would be more effective to separate the different classes. Moreover, we propose a novel ℓ1-norm heteroscedastic discriminant analysis method based on the new discriminant analysis (L1-HDA/GM) for heteroscedastic feature extraction, in which the optimization problem of L1-HDA/GM can be efficiently solved by using eigenvalue decomposition approach. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four real data sets and demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, learning-based (e.g., deep) iterative methods have been empirically shown to be useful for these problems. Nevertheless, integrating learnable structures into iterations is still a laborious process, which can only be guided by intuitions or empirical insights. Moreover, there is a lack of rigorous analysis about the convergence behaviors of these reimplemented iterations, and thus the significance of such methods is a little bit vague. This paper moves beyond these limits and proposes Flexible Iterative Modularization Algorithm (FIMA), a generic and provable paradigm for nonconvex inverse problems. Our theoretical analysis reveals that FIMA allows us to generate globally convergent trajectories for learning-based iterative methods. Meanwhile, the devised scheduling policies on flexible modules should also be beneficial for classical numerical methods in the nonconvex scenario. Extensive experiments on real applications verify the superiority of FIMA.

The micro-video representations, several pioneer efforts proposed, are limited in implicitly exploring the consistency between different modality information but ignore the complementarity. In this paper, we focus on how to explicitly separate the consistent features and the complementary features from the mixed information and harness their combination to improve the expressiveness of each modality. Towards this end, we present a Neural Multimodal Cooperative Learning model (NMCL) to split the consistent component and the complementary component by a novel relation-aware attention mechanism. Specifically, the computed attention score can be used to measure the correlation between the features extracted from different modalities. And then, a threshold is learned for each modality to distinguish the consistent and complementary features, according to the score. Thereafter, we integrate the consistent parts to enhance the representations and supplement the complementary ones to reinforce the information in each modality. As to the problem of redundant information, which may cause overfitting and is hard to distinguish, we devise an attention network to dynamically capture the features which closely related the category and output a discriminative representation for prediction. Experimental results on a real-world micro-video dataset show that NMCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Further studies verify the effectiveness and cooperative effects brought by the attentive mechanism.

Recently, to understand the success of neural networks, much attention has been paid to the relationship between differential equations and neural networks. Some research suggests that the depth of neural networks is important for their success. However, the understanding of neural networks from the differential equation perspective is still very preliminary. In this work, also connecting with the differential equation, we extend the depth of neural networks to infinity, and remove the existing constraint that parameters of every layer have to be the same by using another ordinary differential equation(ODE) to model the evolution of the weights. We prove that the ODE can model any continuous evolutionary weights and validate it by an experiment. Meanwhile, we propose a new training strategy to overcome the inefficiency of pure adjoint method. This strategy allows us to further understand the relationship between ResNet with finite layers and that with infinite layers. Our experiment indicates that the former can be a good initialization of the latter. Finally, we give a heuristic explanation on why the new training method works better than pure adjoint method. Further experiments show that our neural ODE with evolutionary weights converges faster than that with fixed weights.

By imposing virtually adversarial smoothness on the posterior distribution in semisupervised learning, VAT yields an improvement on the performance of GCNs. In addition, due to the difference of property in features, we perturb virtual adversarial perturbations on sparse and dense features, resulting in GCN Sparse VAT (GCNSVAT) and GCN Dense VAT (GCNDVAT) algorithms, respectively. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our two methods across different training sizes.

These deep clustering methods mainly focus on the correlation among samples, e.g., selecting high precision pairs to gradually tune the feature representation, which neglects other useful correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering framework, named deep comprehensive correlation mining (DCCM), for exploring and taking full advantage of various kinds of correlations behind the unlabeled data from three aspects: 1) Instead of only using pairwise information, pseudo-label supervision is proposed to investigate category information and learn discriminative features. 2) The features’ robustness to image transformation of input space is fully explored, which benefits the network learning and significantly improves the performance. 3) The triplet mutual information among features is presented for clustering problem to lift the recently discovered instance-level deep mutual information to a triplet-level formation, which further helps to learn more discriminative features. Extensive experiments on several challenging datasets show that our method achieves good performance, e.g., attaining 62.3% clustering accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is 10.1% higher than the state-of-the-art result.

This unexpected result subverts the classical belief that SGD requires at least O(eps−4) stochastic gradient computations for obtaining an (eps, O(eps0.5))-approximate second-order stationary point. Such SGD rate matches, up to a polylogarithmic factor of problem-dependent parameters, the rate of most accelerated nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithms that adopt additional techniques, such as Nesterov’s momentum acceleration, negative curvature search, as well as quadratic and cubic regularization tricks.

Our model is based on the recently proposed tensor-tensor product (or t-product) [14]. Induced by the t-product, we first rigorously deduce the tensor spectral norm, tensor nuclear norm, and tensor average rank, and show that the tensor nuclear norm is the convex envelope of the tensor average rank within the unit ball of the tensor spectral norm. These definitions, their relationships and properties are consistent with matrix cases. Equipped with the new tensor nuclear norm, we then solve the TRPCA problem by solving a convex program and provide the theoretical guarantee for the exact recovery.

over low rank matrices has broad applications in machine learning. For large scale problems, an attractive heuristic is to factorize the low rank matrix to a product of two much smaller matrices. In this paper, we study the nonconvex problem minU∈Rn×r g(U) = f(UUT) under the assumptions that f(X) is restricted µ-strongly convex and L-smooth on the set {X : X \\geq 0,rank(X) ≤ r}. We propose an accelerated gradient method with alternating constraint that operates directly on the U factors and show that the method has local linear convergence rate with the optimal dependence on the condition number of p L/µ. Globally, our method converges to the critical point with zero gradient from any initializer. Our method also applies to the problem with the asymmetric factorization of X = Ue Ve T and the same convergence result can be obtained. Extensive experimental results verify the advantage of our method.
