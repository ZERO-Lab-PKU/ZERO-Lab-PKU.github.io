As an interesting bridge between physics and deep learning, the equivariant partial differential operators (PDOs) have drawn much researchers' attention recently. However, to ensure the PDOs translation equivariance, previous works have to require coefficient matrices to be constant and spatially shared for their linearity, which could lead to the sub-optimal feature learning at each position. In this work, we propose a novel nonlinear PDOs scheme that is both spatially adaptive and translation equivariant. The coefficient matrices are obtained by local features through a generator rather than spatially shared. Besides, we establish a new theory on incorporating more equivariance like rotations for such PDOs. Based on our theoretical results, we efficiently implement the generator with an equivariant multilayer perceptron (EMLP). As such equivariant PDOs are generated by neural networks, we call them Neural ePDOs. In experiments, we show that our method can significantly improve previous works with smaller model size in various datasets. Especially, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST-rot dataset with only half parameters of the previous best model.

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to SNN conversion method, which is the most effective SNN training method, has successfully converted moderately deep ANNs to SNNs with satisfactory performance. However, this method requires a large number of time-steps, which hurts the energy efficiency of SNNs. How to effectively covert a very deep ANN (e.g., more than 100 layers) to an SNN with a small number of time-steps remains a difficult task. To tackle this challenge, this paper makes the first attempt to propose a novel error analysis framework that takes both the \"quantization error\" and the \"deviation error\" into account, which comes from the discretization of SNN dynamicsthe neuron’s coding scheme and the inconstant input currents at intermediate layers, respectively. Particularly, our theories reveal that the \"deviation error\" depends on both the spike threshold and the input variance. Based on our theoretical analysis, we further propose the Threshold Tuning and Residual Block Restructuring (TTRBR) method that can convert very deep ANNs (\u003e100 layers) to SNNs with negligible accuracy degradation while requiring only a small number of timesteps. With very deep networks, our TTRBR method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet classification tasks.

In this paper, we propose the Differentiation on Spike Representation (DSR) method, which could achieve high performance that is competitive to ANNs yet with low latency. First, we encode the spike trains into spike representation using (weighted) firing rate coding. Based on the spike representation, we systematically derive that the spiking dynamics with common neural models can be represented as some sub-differentiable mapping. With this viewpoint, our proposed DSR method trains SNNs through gradients of the mapping and avoids the common non-differentiability problem in SNN training. Then we analyze the error when representing the specific mapping with the forward computation of the SNN. To reduce such error, we propose to train the spike threshold in each layer, and to introduce a new hyperparameter for the neural models.

However, the supervised training of SNNs remains a hard problem due to the discontinuity of the spiking neuron model. Most existing methods imitate the backpropagation framework and feedforward architectures for artificial neural networks, and use surrogate derivatives or compute gradients with respect to the spiking time to deal with the problem. These approaches either accumulate approximation errors or only propagate information limitedly through existing spikes, and usually require information propagation along time steps with large memory costs and biological implausibility. In this work, we consider feedback spiking neural networks, which are more brain-like, and propose a novel training method that does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. First, we show that the average firing rates of SNNs with feedback connections would gradually evolve to an equilibrium state along time, which follows a fixed-point equation. Then by viewing the forward computation of feedback SNNs as a black-box solver for this equation, and leveraging the implicit differentiation on the equation, we can compute the gradient for parameters without considering the exact forward procedure. In this way, the forward and backward procedures are decoupled and therefore the problem of non-differentiable spiking functions is avoided. We also briefly discuss the biological plausibility of implicit differentiation, which only requires computing another equilibrium. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate the superior performance of our method for feedback models with fewer neurons and parameters in a small number of time steps.

To handle these problems, we propose a point-wise affinity propagation module based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) framework, named PointFlow. Rather than dense affinity learning, a sparse affinity map is generated upon selected points between the adjacent features, which reduces the noise introduced by the background while keeping efficiency.

Furthermore, we develop an architecture derivation method to replace the traditional one that is based on a hand-crafted rule. Our method enables differentiable sparsification, and keeps the derived architecture equivalent to that of Engine-cell, which further improves the consistency between search and evaluation.

To enhance expressive ability, we adopt regular field of cyclic groups as feature fields in intermediate layers, and propose a novel method to parallel transport the feature vectors in these fields. In addition, we project the position vector of each point onto its local coordinate system to disentangle the orientation of the coordinate system in ambient space (\textit {ie}, global coordinate system), achieving rotation invariance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce gauge equivariance to self-attention, thus name our model Gauge Equivariant Transformer (GET), which can be efficiently implemented on triangle meshes. Extensive experiments show that GET achieves state-of-the-art performance on two common recognition tasks.","tags":[],"title":"Gauge Equivariant Transformer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifei Wang","Zhengyang Geng","Feng Jiang","Chuming Li","Yisen Wang","Jiansheng Yang","Zhouchen Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1621555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637395609,"objectID":"4c4cf19dc761ae9017568b51ec0cda58","permalink":"https://ZERO-Lab-PKU.github.io/publication/2021/nips21_residual_relaxation_for_multi-view_representation_learning/","publishdate":"2021-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/nips21_residual_relaxation_for_multi-view_representation_learning/","section":"publication","summary":"Multi-view methods learn representations by aligning multiple views of the same image and their performance largely depends on the choice of data augmentation.

This observation motivates us to relax the exact alignment objective to better cultivate stronger augmentations. Taking image rotation as a case study, we develop a generic approach, Pretext-aware Residual Relaxation (Prelax), that relaxes the exact alignment by allowing an adaptive residual vector between different views and encoding the semantic shift through pretext-aware learning.

Different from existing works, in this paper, we highlight two new characteristics of adversarial examples from the channel-wise activation perspective:  1) the activation magnitudes of adversarial examples are higher than that of natural examples; and 2) the channels are activated more uniformly by adversarial examples than natural examples. We find that, while the state-of-the-art defense adversarial training has addressed the first issue of high activation magnitude via training on adversarial examples, the second issue of uniform activation remains.  This motivates us to suppress redundant activations from being activated by adversarial perturbations during the adversarial training process, via a Channel-wise Activation Suppressing (CAS) training strategy.  We show that CAS can train a model that inherently suppresses adversarial activations, and can be easily applied to existing defense methods to further improve their robustness.

We model the global context issue as a low-rank completion problem and show that its optimization algorithms can help design global information blocks. This paper then proposes a series of Hamburgers, in which we employ the optimization algorithms for solving MDs to factorize the input representations into sub-matrices and reconstruct a low-rank embedding. Hamburgers with different MDs can perform favorably against the popular global context module self-attention when carefully coping with gradients back-propagated through MDs.

We present a type of error-minimizing noise that can indeed make training examples unlearnable. Error-minimizing noise is intentionally generated to reduce the error of one or more of the training example(s) close to zero, which can trick the model into believing there is \"nothing\" to learn from these example(s). The noise is restricted to be imperceptible to human eyes, and thus does not affect normal data utility. We empirically verify the effectiveness of error-minimizing noise in both sample-wise and class-wise forms.

Due to the novel formulation and solving method, LPOM only uses the activation function itself and does not require any gradient steps. Thus it avoids the gradient vanishing or exploding issues, which are often blamed in gradient-based methods. Also, it can handle various non-decreasing Lipschitz continuous activation functions. Additionally, LPOM is almost as memory-efficient as stochastic gradient descent and its parameter tuning is relatively easy. We further implement and analyze the parallel solution of LPOM. We first propose a general asynchronous-parallel BCD method with convergence guarantee. Then we use it to solve LPOM, resulting in asynchronous-parallel LPOM. For faster speed, we develop the synchronous-parallel LPOM. We validate the advantages of LPOM on various network architectures and datasets. We also apply synchronous-parallel LPOM to autoencoder training and demonstrate its fast convergence and superior performance.

Current gradient-based NAS methods commonly ignore the constraint of sparsity in the search phase, but project the optimized solution onto a sparse one by post-processing. As a result, the dense super-net for search is inefficient to train and has a gap with the projected architecture for evaluation. In this paper, we formulate neural architecture search as a sparse coding problem. We perform the differentiable search on a compressed lower-dimensional space that has the same validation loss as the original sparse solution space, and recover an architecture by solving the sparse coding problem. The differentiable search and architecture recovery are optimized in an alternate manner. By doing so, our network for search at each update satisfies the sparsity constraint and is efficient to train. In order to also eliminate the depth and width gap between the network in search and the target-net in evaluation, we further propose a method to search and evaluate in one stage under the target-net settings. When training finishes, architecture variables are absorbed into network weights. Thus we get the searched architecture and optimized parameters in a single run. In experiments, our two-stage method on CIFAR-10 requires only 0.05 GPU-day for search. Our one-stage method produces state-of-the-art performances on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at the cost of only evaluation time.

In this paper, a new paradigm for semantic segmentation is proposed. Our insight is that appealing performance of semantic segmentation requires explicitly modeling the object body and edge, which correspond to the high and low frequency of the image. To do so, we first warp the image feature by learning a flow field to make the object part more consistent. The resulting body feature and the residual edge feature are further optimized under decoupled supervision by explicitly sampling different parts (body or edge) pixels. We show that the proposed framework with various baselines or backbone networks leads to better object inner consistency and object boundaries. Extensive experiments on four major road scene semantic segmentation benchmarks including Cityscapes, Camvid, KIITI and BDD show that our proposed approach establishes new state-of-the-arts while retaining high efficiency in inference. In particular, we achieve 83.7 mIoU % on Cityscape with only fine-annotated data. Code and models will be made available for future research.

However, typical image downscaling is a non-injective mapping due to the loss of high-frequency information, which leads to the ill-posed problem of the inverse upscaling procedure and poses great challenges for recovering details from the downscaled low-resolution images. Simply upscaling with image super-resolution methods results in unsatisfactory recovering performance. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by modeling the downscaling and upscaling processes from a new perspective, i.e. an invertible bijective transformation, which can largely mitigate the ill-posed nature of image upscaling. We develop an Invertible Rescaling Net (IRN) with deliberately designed framework and objectives to produce visually-pleasing low-resolution images and meanwhile capture the distribution of the lost information using a latent variable following a specified distribution in the downscaling process. In this way, upscaling is made tractable by inversely passing a randomly-drawn latent variable with the low-resolution image through the network. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement of our model over existing methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image upscaling reconstruction from downscaled images.

It has been shown that the commonly used Cross Entropy (CE) loss is not robust to noisy labels. Whilst new loss functions have been designed, they are only partially robust. In this paper, we theoretically show by applying a simple normalization that: any loss can be made robust to noisy labels. However, in practice, simply being robust is not sufficient for a loss function to train accurate DNNs. By investigating several robust loss functions, we find that they suffer from a problem of underfitting. To address this, we propose a framework to build robust loss functions called Active Passive Loss (APL). APL combines two robust loss functions that mutually boost each other.

A range of defense techniques have been proposed to improve DNN robustness to adversarial examples, among which adversarial training has been demonstrated to be the most effective. Adversarial training is often formulated as a min-max optimization problem, with the inner maximization for generating adversarial examples. However, there exists a simple, yet easily overlooked fact that adversarial examples are only defined on correctly classified (natural) examples, but inevitably, some (natural) examples will be misclassified during training. In this paper, we investigate the distinctive influence of misclassified and correctly classified examples on the final robustness of adversarial training. Specifically, we find that misclassified examples indeed have a significant impact on the final robustness. More surprisingly, we find that different maximization techniques on misclassified examples may have a negligible influence on the final robustness, while different minimization techniques are crucial. Motivated by the above discovery, we propose a new defense algorithm called {\u001bm Misclassification Aware adveRsarial Training} (MART), which explicitly differentiates the misclassified and correctly classified examples during the training. We also propose a semi-supervised extension of MART, which can leverage the unlabeled data to further improve the robustness. Experimental results show that MART and its variant could significantly improve the state-of-the-art adversarial robustness.","tags":["Adversarial Robustness","Misclassified Examples"],"title":"Improving Adversarial Robustness Requires Revisiting Misclassified Examples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongxian Wu","Yisen Wang","Shu-Tao Xia","James Bailey","Xingjun Ma"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585670400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600094648,"objectID":"46c688c7a9c5d9ce5c83d1634a95a16c","permalink":"https://ZERO-Lab-PKU.github.io/publication/2020/iclr20_skip_connections_matter_on_the_transferability_of_adversarial_examples_generated_with_resnets/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/iclr20_skip_connections_matter_on_the_transferability_of_adversarial_examples_generated_with_resnets/","section":"publication","summary":"Skip connections are an essential component of current state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) such as ResNet, WideResNet, DenseNet, and ResNeXt.

Use of skip connections \textit{allows easier generation of highly transferable adversarial examples}. Specifically, in ResNet-like (with skip connections) neural networks, gradients can backpropagate through either skip connections or residual modules. We find that using more gradients from the skip connections rather than the residual modules according to a decay factor, allows one to craft adversarial examples with high transferability. Our method is termed \u001bmph{Skip Gradient Method} (SGM). We conduct comprehensive transfer attacks against state-of-the-art DNNs including ResNets, DenseNets, Inceptions, Inception-ResNet, Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) and robustly trained DNNs. We show that employing SGM on the gradient flow can greatly improve the transferability of crafted attacks in almost all cases. Furthermore, SGM can be easily combined with existing black-box attack techniques, and obtain high improvements over state-of-the-art transferability methods. Our findings not only motivate new research into the architectural vulnerability of DNNs, but also open up further challenges for the design of secure DNN architectures.","tags":["Skip Connections","Adversarial Transferability"],"title":"Skip Connections Matter: On the Transferability of Adversarial Examples Generated with ResNets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xia Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583038800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583825056,"objectID":"71b0383fb379cd451670b6754a54b36f","permalink":"https://ZERO-Lab-PKU.github.io/post/jlmr20/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T13:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/jlmr20/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"One paper was accepted by JMLR!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Huan Li","Zhouchen Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1582992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593864398,"objectID":"382702864ab4470b864d2ec646ac46a7","permalink":"https://ZERO-Lab-PKU.github.io/publication/2020/jmlr20_on_the_complexity_analysis_of_the_primal_solutions_for_the_accelerated_randomized_dual_coordinate_ascent/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/jmlr20_on_the_complexity_analysis_of_the_primal_solutions_for_the_accelerated_randomized_dual_coordinate_ascent/","section":"publication","summary":"Our study aims to give the convergence rate analysis of the primal solutions for the accelerated randomized dual coordinate ascent.","tags":["Accelerated Randomized Dual Coordinate Ascent","Primal Solutions","Convergence Theory"],"title":"On the Complexity Analysis of the Primal Solutions for the Accelerated Randomized Dual Coordinate Ascent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xia Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582520400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582811569,"objectID":"e1b6efa462a4319f410517bc34033875","permalink":"https://ZERO-Lab-PKU.github.io/post/cvpr20/","publishdate":"2020-02-24T13:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/cvpr20/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"One paper was accepted by CVPR 2020!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Xia Li","Yibo Yang","Qijie Zhao","Tiancheng Shen","Zhouchen Lin","Hong Liu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1582473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594712054,"objectID":"1aafa26ff45580d60d3c2051dc2b6b9b","permalink":"https://ZERO-Lab-PKU.github.io/publication/2020/cvpr20_spatial_pyramid_graph_reasoning_for_semantic_segmentation/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020/cvpr20_spatial_pyramid_graph_reasoning_for_semantic_segmentation/","section":"publication","summary":"The convolution operation suffers from a limited receptive filed, while global modeling is fundamental to dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation.

It is proven to have an o(1/√K) nonergodic convergence rate and a faster O(1/K) ergodic rate after ergodic averaging, where K is the number of iterations. Such nonergodic convergence rate is not optimal. Moreover, the ergodic averaging may destroy the sparseness and low-rankness in sparse and low-rank learning. In this paper, we modify the accelerated ADMM proposed in Ouyang et al. (SIAM J. Imaging Sci. 7(3):1588–1623, 2015) and give an O(1/K) nonergodic convergence rate analysis, which satisfies |F(xK ) − F(x∗)| ≤ O(1/K), ||AxK − b|| ≤ O(1/K) and xK has a more favorable sparseness and low-rankness than the ergodic peer, where F(x)is the objective function and Ax = b is the linear constraint. As far as we know, this is the first O(1/K) nonergodic convergent ADMM type method for the general linearly constrained convex problems. Moreover, we show that the lower complexity bound of ADMM type methods for the separable linearly constrained nonsmooth convex problems is O(1/K), which means that our method is optimal.

It is defined as the generalized Rayleigh quotient of the between-class scatter distance to the within-class scatter distance. Consequently, Fisher’s criterion does not take advantage of the discriminant information in the class covariance differences and hence its discriminant ability largely depends on the class mean differences. If the class mean distances are relatively large compared with the within-class scatter distance, Fisher’s criterion based discriminant analysis methods may achieve a good discriminant performance. Otherwise, it may not deliver good results. Moreover, we observe that the between-class distance of Fisher’s criterion is based on the ℓ2 norm, which would be disadvantageous to separate the classes with smaller class mean distances. To overcome the drawback of Fisher’s criterion, in this paper we firstly derive a new discriminant criterion, expressed as a mixture of absolute generalized Rayleigh quotients (MAGRQ), based on a Bayes error upper bound estimation, where mixture of Gaussians is adopted to approximate the real distribution of data samples. Then, the criterion is further modified by replacing ℓ2 norm with ℓ1 one to better describe the between-class scatter distance, such that it would be more effective to separate the different classes. Moreover, we propose a novel ℓ1-norm heteroscedastic discriminant analysis method based on the new discriminant analysis (L1-HDA/GM) for heteroscedastic feature extraction, in which the optimization problem of L1-HDA/GM can be efficiently solved by using eigenvalue decomposition approach. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four real data sets and demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, learning-based (e.g., deep) iterative methods have been empirically shown to be useful for these problems. Nevertheless, integrating learnable structures into iterations is still a laborious process, which can only be guided by intuitions or empirical insights. Moreover, there is a lack of rigorous analysis about the convergence behaviors of these reimplemented iterations, and thus the significance of such methods is a little bit vague. This paper moves beyond these limits and proposes Flexible Iterative Modularization Algorithm (FIMA), a generic and provable paradigm for nonconvex inverse problems. Our theoretical analysis reveals that FIMA allows us to generate globally convergent trajectories for learning-based iterative methods. Meanwhile, the devised scheduling policies on flexible modules should also be beneficial for classical numerical methods in the nonconvex scenario. Extensive experiments on real applications verify the superiority of FIMA.

Though a number of approaches have been proposed for learning with noisy labels, many open issues remain. In this paper, we show that DNN learning with Cross Entropy (CE) exhibits overfitting to noisy labels on some classes (“easy” classes), but more surprisingly, it also suffers from significant under learning on some other classes (“hard” classes). Intuitively, CE requires an extra term to facilitate learning of hard classes, and more importantly, this term should be noise tolerant, so as to avoid overfitting to noisy labels. Inspired by the symmetric KL-divergence, we propose the approach of Symmetric cross entropy Learning (SL), boosting CE symmetrically with a noise robust counterpart Reverse Cross Entropy (RCE). Our proposed SL approach simultaneously addresses both the under learning and overfitting problem of CE in the presence of noisy labels. We provide a theoretical analysis of SL and also empirically show, on a range of benchmark and real-world datasets, that SL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also show that SL can be easily incorporated into existing methods in order to further enhance their performance.","tags":["Noisy Label","Symmetric Cross Entropy"],"title":"Symmetric Cross Entropy

The micro-video representations, several pioneer efforts proposed, are limited in implicitly exploring the consistency between different modality information but ignore the complementarity. In this paper, we focus on how to explicitly separate the consistent features and the complementary features from the mixed information and harness their combination to improve the expressiveness of each modality. Towards this end, we present a Neural Multimodal Cooperative Learning model (NMCL) to split the consistent component and the complementary component by a novel relation-aware attention mechanism. Specifically, the computed attention score can be used to measure the correlation between the features extracted from different modalities. And then, a threshold is learned for each modality to distinguish the consistent and complementary features, according to the score. Thereafter, we integrate the consistent parts to enhance the representations and supplement the complementary ones to reinforce the information in each modality. As to the problem of redundant information, which may cause overfitting and is hard to distinguish, we devise an attention network to dynamically capture the features which closely related the category and output a discriminative representation for prediction. Experimental results on a real-world micro-video dataset show that NMCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Further studies verify the effectiveness and cooperative effects brought by the attentive mechanism.

However, the understanding of neural networks from the differential equation perspective is still very preliminary. In this work, also connecting with the differential equation, we extend the depth of neural networks to infinity, and remove the existing constraint that parameters of every layer have to be the same by using another ordinary differential equation(ODE) to model the evolution of the weights. We prove that the ODE can model any continuous evolutionary weights and validate it by an experiment. Meanwhile, we propose a new training strategy to overcome the inefficiency of pure adjoint method. This strategy allows us to further understand the relationship between ResNet with finite layers and that with infinite layers. Our experiment indicates that the former can be a good initialization of the latter. Finally, we give a heuristic explanation on why the new training method works better than pure adjoint method.

As far as we know, this is the first O(1/K) nonergodic convergentADMM type method for the general linearly constrained convex problems. Moreover, weshow that the lower complexity bound of ADMM type methods for the separable linearlyconstrained nonsmooth convex problems is O(1/K), which means that our method is optimal.

Across existing defense techniques, adversarial training with Projected Gradient Decent (PGD) is amongst the most effective. Adversarial training solves a min-max optimization problem, with the inner maximization generating adversarial examples by maximizing the classification loss, and the outer minimization finding model parameters by minimizing the loss on adversarial examples generated from the inner maximization. A criterion that measures how well the inner maximization is solved is therefore crucial for adversarial training. In this paper, we propose such a criterion, namely First-Order Stationary Condition for constrained optimization (FOSC), to quantitatively evaluate the convergence quality of adversarial examples found in the inner maximization. With FOSC, we find that to ensure better robustness, it is essential to use adversarial examples with better convergence quality at the later stages of training. Yet at the early stages, high convergence quality adversarial examples are not necessary and may even lead to poor robustness. Based on these observations, we propose a dynamic training strategy to gradually increase the convergence quality of the generated adversarial examples, which significantly improves the robustness of adversarial training. Our theoretical and empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","tags":["Adversarial Robustness","Convergence Score"],"title":"On the Convergence and Robustness of Adversarial Training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gaopeng Jian","Zhouchen Lin","Rongquan Feng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593864398,"objectID":"8c18677230a7619be05e2ddba2be4708","permalink":"https://ZERO-Lab-PKU.github.io/publication/helingshen/ffta19_two-weight_and_three-weight_linear_codes_based_on_weil_sums/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/helingshen/ffta19_two-weight_and_three-weight_linear_codes_based_on_weil_sums/","section":"publication","summary":"Linear codes with few weights have applications insecret sharing,authentication codes,association schemes and strongly regular graphs.

These deep clustering methods mainly focus on the correlation among samples, e.g., selecting high precision pairs to gradually tune the feature representation, which neglects other useful correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering framework, named deep comprehensive correlation mining (DCCM), for exploring and taking full advantage of various kinds of correlations behind the unlabeled data from three aspects: 1) Instead of only using pairwise information, pseudo-label supervision is proposed to investigate category information and learn discriminative features. 2) The features’ robustness to image transformation of input space is fully explored, which benefits the network learning and significantly improves the performance. 3) The triplet mutual information among features is presented for clustering problem to lift the recently discovered instance-level deep mutual information to a triplet-level formation, which further helps to learn more discriminative features. Extensive experiments on several challenging datasets show that our method achieves good performance, e.g., attaining 62.3% clustering accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is 10.1% higher than the state-of-the-art result.

This unexpected result subverts the classical belief that SGD requires at least O(eps−4) stochastic gradient computations for obtaining an (eps, O(eps0.5))-approximate second-order stationary point. Such SGD rate matches, up to a polylogarithmic factor of problem-dependent parameters, the rate of most accelerated nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithms that adopt additional techniques, such as Nesterov’s momentum acceleration, negative curvature search, as well as quadratic and cubic regularization tricks. Our novel analysis gives new insights into nonconvex SGD and can be potentially generalized to a broad class of stochastic optimization algorithms.

Our model is based on the recently proposed tensor-tensor product (or t-product) [14]. Induced by the t-product, we first rigorously deduce the tensor spectral norm, tensor nuclear norm, and tensor average rank, and show that the tensor nuclear norm is the convex envelope of the tensor average rank within the unit ball of the tensor spectral norm. These definitions, their relationships and properties are consistent with matrix cases. Equipped with the new tensor nuclear norm, we then solve the TRPCA problem by solving a convex program and provide the theoretical guarantee for the exact recovery. Our TRPCA model and recovery guarantee include matrix RPCA as a special case. Numerical experiments verify our results, and the applications to image recovery and background modeling problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

over low rank matrices has broad applications in machine learning. For large scale problems, an attractive heuristic is to factorize the low rank matrix to a product of two much smaller matrices. In this paper, we study the nonconvex problem minU∈Rn×r g(U) = f(UUT) under the assumptions that f(X) is restricted µ-strongly convex and L-smooth on the set {X : X \\geq 0,rank(X) ≤ r}. We propose an accelerated gradient method with alternating constraint that operates directly on the U factors and show that the method has local linear convergence rate with the optimal dependence on the condition number of p L/µ. Globally, our method converges to the critical point with zero gradient from any initializer. Our method also applies to the problem with the asymmetric factorization of X = Ue Ve T and the same convergence result can be obtained. Extensive experimental results verify the advantage of our method.
